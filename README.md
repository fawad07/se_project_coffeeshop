# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project
In the future I would like to add a hover feature on the menu cards so that it looks like the menu pops out to the user and make the text look bigger while the mouse is hovering over the card.

Add your ideas here :)
